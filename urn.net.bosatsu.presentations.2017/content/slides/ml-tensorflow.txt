#About TensorFlow
- Open source library for numerical computation from Google Brain Team

--
- Version 1.0 was just released

--
- Primarily for machine learning and deep neural network research

--
- Data flow graph-based

--
- Nodes represent operations

--
- Tensors flow through the nodes

--
- Leverages CPUs and/or GPUs

--
- Ecosystem for graph visualization, serving production models, etc.
