Credit cards have high transaction fees. Have to provide your details to each vendor unless you use an intermediary like PayPal. This keeps you from dealing with the merchants directly and requires everyone to have a centralized account.

I hope it’s obvious it was only the centrally controlled nature of those systems that doomed them. I think this is the first time we’re trying a decentralized, non-trust-based system.]
