.quotation[Machine-learned models are often parts of complex systems comprising a large number of data sources and interacting components, which are commonly entangled together. This creates large surfaces on which bugs can grow and unexpected interactions can develop, potentially to the detriment of end-user experiences via the degradation of the machine-learned model.]

.quotation[Mainstream hardware is becoming permanently parallel, heterogeneous, and distributed. These changes are permanent, and so will permanently affect the way we have to write performance-intensive code on mainstream architectures.]
